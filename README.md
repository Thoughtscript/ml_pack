# ml_pack

Simple, unified, stable set of webpack dependencies to abstract Node projects.

# What?

Stable, dependency, base for simplifying Node scaffolds.

# How Do I Use This?

Using Node: `8.8.0`

```
{
	//...
	"dependencies": {
		"ml_pack": "git+https://github.com/Thoughtscript/ml_pack"
	},
	/...
}
```

Then, since those dependencies live in your `node_modules`, you can `require` or `import` them normally. Hooray!
